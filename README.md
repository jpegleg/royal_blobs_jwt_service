# royal_blobs_jwt_service

This program is meant to be updated before any real use.

There are hard coded HMAC and identity values in the template.

The service runs locally within a backend, providing JWT + BLAKE2 of JWT + blob back to the caller, logging UUID and BLAKE2 of JWT in the service.

This servive is not meant to provide security by itself, but instead is to be used within a backend API.
